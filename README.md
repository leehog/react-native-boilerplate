### Start your emulator:

For example, majje is using the apt-package 'emulator', and will therefore
firstly list his available virtual devices:

` emulator -list-avds `

Having decided what device to use, he confidently types:

` emulator -avd [avd-name] `


### Running the app:

Simply type:

` npm run [OS] `

Example: ` npm run android `
